# Git Basics
* `git init` - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* `git status` - I can use this anytime to see the current status of the repository
* `git add <file>` - places the file in the git staging area
* `git commit -m "documentation text" - commits the changes from the staging area
* `git diff` - compare the changes of your last added file to the file in your repository
* `git diff --staged` - compare the changes of the staged file to the file in your repository
* `git log" - shows a list of the changes to your repository
