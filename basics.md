# Git Basics
* `git init` - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* `git status` - I can use this anytime to see the current status of the repository
* `git add <file>` - places the file in the git staging area
* `git commit -m "documentation text"` - commits the changes from the staging area
* `git diff` - compare the changes of your last added file to the file in your repository
* `git diff --staged` - compare the changes of the staged file to the file in your repository
* `git log` - shows reverse chronological list of commits

* `git remote add origin https://github.com/jensmuehle/learning-git.git` 
* `git remote -v` - check status of remote repositories
* `git push -u origin master` - push local file to remote repository
* `git pull origin master` - pull any changes from remote repository to local repository
